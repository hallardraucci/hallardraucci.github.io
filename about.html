      <h2>Why did I choose computer science?</h2>
      <p class="main">
        As a little girl, my "dream job" was to become a video game designer. I
        loved playing video games and I was interested in how they were created.
        As I grew up, my dad enforced the idea that computers were going to one
        day rule the world and it is important to stay in a field involving
        them. He himself works in a Data Analytics team. When it came time to
        choose what high school I wanted to attend, I decided to go to a
        technical high school. I went to Platt Technical High School where I
        studied computer aided design and drafting as a trade. I gained
        experience in both AutoCAD and SolidWorks. My senior project was to
        construct a foosball table in SolidWorks and later in real life.
        Pictures of the progression of our project can be seen
        <a href="Powerpoint/foosball_presentation.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
        Learning this trade helped me realize that I wanted to remain in the
        engineering field. Once I reached college, I took my dad's advice and
        chose to study Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). Although this
        major does align with my "dream job", I no longer want to do this. I am
        not entirely sure what I want to do so here I am living day by day.

      <h2>What do I like to do in my free time?</h2>
      <p class="main">
        Whether it be swimming, running, or hiking I love being active. I
        aquired an interest in swimming freshman year of college. A friend of
        mine asked me if I would be interested in doing a triatholon with her. I
        had never swam competitively and couldn't even remember when I last rode
        a bike. I thought to myself, why not? We started training early by
        swimming and running during the week and going for bike rides on the
        weekends. After competing in the triatholon, I went out and bought
        myself a swim training book to follow. I have gained a passion in
        swimming, I find it to be fun and an easy way to get my mind off things.
        On the other hand, running has been one of my passions for a very long
        time. I joined the cross country team when I was in 8th grade. I
        continued doing cross country for all four years of high school.
        Unfortunately, every year our team had the minimum amount of girls we
        could have to compete: five. My senior year we only had four girls which
        disqualified us in every meet. This did not stop me, I continued to try
        my hardest to compete against myself and teammates. I earned
        varsity every year and became captain my senior year. Throughout high
        school I also did indoor and outdoor track. I did indoor freshman through
        junior year, while doing outdoor for all four years. My events ranged
        from 400, 800, 4x4, 4x8, to even the 1600 meters. Although I did cross
        country, I found my favorite event to be the 4x8 or the 800 meter. Now
        that I am in college I continue to be active for myself.
