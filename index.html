                    <p class="main"> Hello! My name is Hayley Allard-Raucci. I am currently a 
                        senior at the University of Connecticut, majoring in Computer Science &
                        Engineering and minoring in Mathematics. I spend my free time either swimming,
                        running, or playing Sims.

                    <h2> Life as a Senior </h2>
                    <p class ="main"> For starters, I am only taking two classes
                        to finish off my requirements for graduation this May. I am
                        enrolled in Digital Systems Design and Senior Design. Senior Design consists of
                        a project sponsored by either UConn or an industry. I am working with three others
                        on Energy Load Forecasting sponsored by <a href="https://www.powwr.com/">POWWR</a>. 
                        The goal of this project is to use machine learning to produce a model that will
                        predict energy consumption strictly using recorded hourly usage and weather data from
                        the past.
                    </p>
                    <p class="main">
                        When I am not at school, I am at my internship at 
                        <a href="https://www.iso-ne.com/">ISO New England</a>. I have been interning here
                        since June 2018. I started in their IT Day-Ahead Support team located in Holyoke, MA
                        but, now that I am back in Connecticut I have moved to their Operations Performance, Integration 
                        and Training team in Windsor, CT.
