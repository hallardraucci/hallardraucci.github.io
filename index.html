                    <p class="main"> Hello! My name is Hayley Allard-Raucci. I am currently a 
                        senior at the University of Connecticut, majoring in Computer Science &
                        Engineering and minoring in Mathematics. I spend my free time either swimming,
                        running, or playing Sims.

                    <h2> Life as a Senior </h2>
                    <p class ="main"> For starters, I am only taking two classes
                        to finish off my requirements for graduation this May. I am
                        enrolled in Digital Systems Design and Senior Design. Senior Design consists of
                        a project sponsored by either UConn or an industry. I am working with three others
                        on Energy Load Forecasting sponsored by <a href="https://www.powwr.com/">POWWR</a>. 
                        The goal of this project is to use machine learning to produce a model that will
                        predict energy consumption strictly using recorded hourly usage and weather data from
                        the past. We successfully created a model with a mean absolute percentage error of 3.63%,
                        an improvement from our goal 10% error. We will move on to creating an additional model using
                        data from more weather stations.

                    <p class="main">
                        When I am not at school, I am at my internship with 
                        <a href="https://www.iso-ne.com/">ISO New England</a>. I have been interning here
                        since June 2018. I started in their IT Day-Ahead Support team located in Holyoke, MA
                        but, now that I am back in Connecticut I have moved to their Operations Performance, Training 
                        and Integration (OPTI) team in Windsor, CT. I am currently working on creating a Microsoft
                        Access Database with user functionalities to save, load, and edit current project data. Within this, 
                        the user can generate summary reports identifying the stages completed of various projects for the 
                        current month.
