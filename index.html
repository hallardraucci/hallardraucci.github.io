          Hello! My name is Hayley Allard-Raucci. I am currently a senior at the
          University of Connecticut, majoring in Computer Science & Engineering
          and minoring in Mathematics. I spend my free time either swimming,
          running, or playing Sims.

        <h2>Life as a Senior</h2>
        <p class="main">
          For starters, I am only taking two classes to finish off my
          requirements for graduation this May. I am enrolled in Digital Systems
          Design and Senior Design. Digital Systems Design is a class focused on
          hardware programming in VHDL. I chose to take this class not only to
          enhance my hardware skills but also for my interest in circuits.
          Senior Design consists of a project sponsored by either UConn or an
          industry. I am working with three others on Energy Load Forecasting
          sponsored by
          <a href="https://www.powwr.com/" target="_blank">POWWR</a>. The goal
          of this project is to use machine learning to produce a model that
          will predict energy consumption strictly using recorded hourly usage
          and weather data from the past. We successfully created a model with a
          mean absolute percentage error of 3.63%, an improvement from our goal
          of 10% error. This semester we will move on in creating an additional
          model using data in larger areas. This will force us to group weather
          station data by zone to find their average temperature and hourly
          usage data.
        </p>
        <p class="main">
          When I am not at school, I am at my internship with
          <a href="https://www.iso-ne.com/" target="_blank">ISO New England</a>.
          I have been interning here since June 2018. I was accepted into their
          IT-Day Ahead Support team for the summer internship program. During
          this program, I gained more knowledge and experience in the electrical
          power systems industry. We visited a trash plant, a wind farm, and a
          nuclear powerplant. ISO held lunches with VPs to not only hear their
          experiences but, ask them questions. Once summer ended, I was asked if
          I would like to continue my internship through out the school year
          with the option to switch departments. I am now in their Operations
          Performance, Training and Integration team located in Windsor, CT.
        </p>
        <p class="main">
          If I am not too busy working on homework or away in Windsor, I am
          hanging out with my friends. Our favorite activities are hiking, going
          out to eat, and staying at home to watch a movie. The majority of my
          friends are also computer science majors so we are constantly
          discussing anything related to computers. Whether it be video games,
          classes, homework, or job oppurtunities in general. We all share the
          same passion and have the same goal to one day become a software
          engineer.
