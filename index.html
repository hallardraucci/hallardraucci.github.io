          Hello! My name is Hayley Allard-Raucci. I recently graduated from the University of Connecticut
          back in May 2019. I majored in Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) and minored in Mathematics. 
          I spent my senior year interning at <a href="https://www.iso-ne.com/" target="_blank">ISO New England</a>
          for their operational performance training & integration (OPTI) team. If you have no idea what that means
          or what I could have been doing, check out my experience in depth and read more about it!

        <h2> Life as a Graduate</h2>
        <p class="main">
          My life since I have graduated has not been very exciting. I finished up my internship at
          <a href="https://www.iso-ne.com/" target="_blank">ISO New England</a> at the end of May. I will be 
          starting a full-time position as a TECDP Associate in July for 
          <a href="https://www.cigna.com/" target="_blank">Cigna</a>. In the meantime, 
          I decided to fly to Florida and visit my grandma. This has been a nice break from school, work, and my
          family. Now that I have a lot of time to do literally anything, I resumed reading books I had on hold while
          I was at school. I also have taught myself through YouTube how to crochet. When most people hear crochet they
          think of scarves, hats, sweaters, etc. Thats too generic for me, I have been crocheting animals and food! 
        </p>
        <h4> Here's one of my masterpieces! </h4>
        <img src="Pictures/crochet/Ice_cream.jpg" class="img-3" style="float:left; padding-right: 10px; border-radius: 20%"> 
        I apologize if this made you crave a nice ice cream cone. Go ahead, you definitely deserve one after 
        your hard work today! Stay tuned for more of my creations. If you know me or work with me, don't hesitate to ask
        me to make you something!
