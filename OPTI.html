        I continued my internship at ISO New England from the summer into the school year.
        ISO New England is a not-for-profit organizaton that
        operates the New England power grid, ensuring reliable flow of energy. I switched from IT-Day Ahead Support to
        Operations Performance,
        Training & Integration (OPTI). OPTI is a department whose main job is to support the operators in the
        control room. They support tools that the operators are using every single day.
      </p>
      <p class="main">
        Winter was approaching very quickly and the team had still not finished their tool for the fuel and emissions
        survey responses. These surveys are used to keep track of how much oil or coal are being used and held in
        New England generators. When the cold months hit, these survey responses are generated into a report that is
        created weekly or biweekly depending on the month. My first project was to help finish this tool before these
        reports
        were needed weekly. The first
        task was to create various views to separate the data within the database needed for the report. I altered
        existing
        tables within the database to include information needed to help modify the tool being used in VBA. The tool
        would
        automatically grab these responses from the survey and import the data into their corresponding tables. The
        weekly fuel
        and emissions reports consisted of charts and graphs for the operators to have and review. I contributed to
        this report
        by implementing automation of a bar chart graph through VBA. The graph displayed each generator with their fuel
        availability, the date they will run out of fuel, when they ordered more fuel, and lastly how long that fuel
        they
        ordered will last. I also wrote a program that combines multiple comments into one entry by generator name
        without
        duplicating entries by iterating through the database. The combined comments were copied into an excel sheet
        that was
        exported on the report through CSLT and XML. Lastly, I modified an existing XSLT code to highlight stations at
        risk due
        to their availability in the table. They were either highlighted in yellow or red depending on how low they
        were on
        fuel. These reports were very important during the cold months of the year. I also created a program that would
        iterate
        through the sheets of an existing Excel sheet used to keep track of the consumption rates of various consumable
        fuels
        for generators and import the data into the databaseâ€™s corresponding tables. Only values that did not exist
        would be
        imported into the corresponding table. I later modified this code to prompt the user to select the file they
        would like
        to use to import the data.

      </p>
      <p class="main">
        Once the programs for the reports were completed I moved on to something new. To keep track of the progress on
        projects, OPTI was using a tool in which used a userform to store information on an excel sheet. I was asked
        to modify this tool by using a database to store the data rather than an excel sheet. I structured a database
        from
        scratch by looking at how
        the tool was used currently. I designed an entity relationship diagram and presented it to my supervisor and a
        co-worker. We went over the design
        together to ensure things were linked together properly to allow me to begin creating it. I created the
        database using
        Microsoft Access. I then moved
        onto modifying the tool in VBA to grab the data from the userform and store it into the database. I designed
        user
        functionality to create, save, edit,
        and load exsting data for projects. I added all the userform questions into the database to heavily test my new
        tool,
        ensuring there were no bugs and
        no data was being saved as a duplicate value. My supervisor then tested the tool with real data to ensure it
        was
        working properly and looked the way
        he wanted.

      </p>
      <p class="main">
        All members of the OPTI department were asked to become familiar with various market system engines. The task
        was to gather, analyze and present data
        for the run time of these engines. This was done by looking through tables within the database to find the
        start and end time for the corresponding study mode
        and case ID number. Each engine had a unique study mode and case ID. Once finding the tables that held the
        information needed, I created a query to join them and
        pull the numbers. I imported them onto an excel sheet where I subtracted the start from end to find the total
        run time. I then graphed the run time
        for all of 2018 to see if there were any outliers or how the tool was working in general.
      </p>
      <p class="main">
        Due to the new fuel and emissions database being finished, there was necessary clean up for the old database
        and tool. My next task was to remove the fuel survey
        button from the old tool completely. This consisted of deleting VBA code and deleting queries within the
        database. To ensure all unnecessary queries were removed
        from the database, I went through the tool checking which queries were used or not. Once I documented all of
        them, I checked the object dependies to make sure the
        unused queries were not being depended on by nes needed. Once thoroughly checking, I began deleting them and
        checking each button on the tool to make sure they were
        all still working properly. After removing them, I started to delete code that was no longer needed or simply
        was not being used. This reduced the clutter of code making
        it easier to identify a bug if needed.
      </p>
      <p class="main">
        My next task was to modify an existing tool called the Notification Tracker in C#. This tool had many
        functionalities
        including the ability to email recipients from triggered specified notification with regarding information.
        With my
        modifications on the C# code and database, the user was now able to choose whether the email recipient would
        receive
        the email as a to, CC, and/or BCC. The email was now sent in HTML allowing the user to modify tags to add
        formatting
        within the database to make important information stick out to the receivers. Along with automation of tables
        being
        created, if necessary, in email notifications. I also added the ability to change the format of dates and
        numbers
        within the email. These modifications were tested heavily through various inputs that would break the code
        without
        proper error handling. The last task I needed to finish before my internship ended was to create a userform for
        this
        existing tool. There needed to be two buttons, one for the control room functionalities and one for the email
        side. MS
        Access and Oracle databases were used to obtain the necessary data. The email side functionalities included the
        ability
        to add or edit an event from the Oracle database that would trigger a notification. Within this event, the user
        was
        able to add/edit/delete email addresses, with the option to change their to/CC/BCC. Depending on the event, a
        list of
        existing entry parts for the particular notification from the Oracle database displayed in the userform for the
        user to
        add/delete them from the email. The user was also able to edit the email details such as the subject. All the
        data for
        the email side was stored in the MS Access database and all changes with a description was logged in a
        specified table.
        The control room side was broken up into three userforms following the three tables within the MS Access
        database:
        events, notifications, and recipients. These tables are linked by the notification table, identifying the
        recipients
        for each event. The operators would use this useform to edit the mapping of the notifications along with the
        ability to
        edit/add/delete events and recipients. All changes were logged the same way as the email side.
