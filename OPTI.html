        I continued my internship at ISO New England from the summer into the school year.
        ISO New England is a not-for-profit organizaton that
        operates the New England power grid, ensuring reliable flow of energy.  I switched from IT-Day Ahead Support to Operations Performance,
        Training & Integration (OPTI). OPTI is a department whose main job is to support the operators in the
        control room. They support tools that the operators are using every single day. 
      </p>
      <p class="main">
        Winter was approaching very quickly and the team had still not finished their tool for the fuel and emissions
        survey responses. These surveys are used to keep track of how much oil or coal are being used and held in 
        New England generators. When the cold months hit, these survey responses are generated into a report that is 
        created weekly. My first project was to help finish this tool before these reports were needed weekly. The first
        task was to create various views to separate the data within the database needed for pages in the report.  
      </p>
      <p class="main">
        I altered an existing table in the database that held the survey questions to include check boxes to distiguish whether
        the question were talking about maximum or current coal or oil. This helped me modify the existing tool in VBA 
        to automatically grab these responses from the survey and import the data into their corresponding tables within the 
        database. To prevent duplications, the values were first checked to see if they already existed. If the values did not exist,
        the database was updated to mark the old values deleted with a deletion note containing a reason why it was being deleted, who
        it was being deleted by, and the date. This is very important to identify the amount of fuel still remaining in each generator and
        determine how long they can continue to run.  
      </p>
      <p class="main">
        The weekly fuel and emissions reports consisted of charts and graphs for the operators to have and review. I contributed to this report 
        by implementing automation of a bar chart graph through VBA. The graph displayed each generator with their fuel availability, 
        the date they will run out of fuel, when they ordered more fuel, and lastly how long that fuel they ordered will last.
        I also wrote a program that goes through the database view I created for any additional comments the generators have and
        combined multiple comments into one entry by generator name without duplicating entries. The combined comments were copied
        into an excel sheet that was exported on the report through XSLT and XML. Lastly, I modified an existing XSLT code to highlight 
        stations at risk due to their availability in the table. They were either highlighted in yellow or red depending on how low 
        they were on fuel. 
      </p>
      <p class="main">
        By using an existing Excel sheet, I created a program that grabs the information from the sheet and
        imports the data into the database. The code iterated through the sheets in the workbook matching the assetID of the generators with 
        the assetID's in the database to confirm they were the same. If they were the same, it would then check the corresponding generators 
        primary and alternate fuel against one of the views I wrote. Depending on which fuel the generator used, it would then iterate through 
        the consumable's fuel type checking whether a consumption rate value existed or not. If there was a value, it would check the database to see
        if the same value already exists. If it did not, it would mark the old value as deleted and imported the new value in the corresponding table. 
        I later modified this code due to us creating a new template excel sheet to be used. The new template was set up differently, it no longer
        held information about alternate and primary fuel. The program now prompts the user to select the file they would like to use and it would then
        iterate through that excel sheet importing data to corresponding tables.
      </p>
      <p class="main">
        To keep track of the progress on projects, OPTI was using a tool in which used a userform to store information on an excel sheet. I was asked 
        to modify this tool by using a database to store the data rather than an excel sheet. I structured a database from scratch by looking at how 
        the tool was used currently. I designed an entity relationship diagram and presented it to my supervisor and a co-worker. We went over the design 
        together to ensure things were linked together properly to allow me to begin creating it. I created the database using Microsoft Access. I then moved
        onto modifying the tool in VBA to grab the data from the userform and store it into the database. I designed user functionality to create, save, edit, 
        and load exsting data for projects. I added all the userform questions into the database to heavily test my new tool, ensuring there were no bugs and 
        no data was being saved as a duplicate value. My supervisor then tested the tool with real data to ensure it was working properly and looked the way
        he wanted. 
      </p>
      <p class="main">
        All members of the OPTI department were asked to become familiar with various market system engines. The task was to gather, analyze and present data 
        for the run time of these engines. This was done by looking through tables within the database to find the start and end time for the corresponding study mode
        and case ID number. Each engine had a unique study mode and case ID. Once finding the tables that held the information needed, I created a query to join them and 
        pull the numbers. I imported them onto an excel sheet where I subtracted the start from end to find the total run time. I then graphed the run time 
        for all of 2018 to see if there were any outliers or how the tool was working in general. 
      </p>
      <p class="main">
        Due to the new fuel and emissions database being finished, there was necessary clean up for the old database and tool. My next task was to remove the fuel survey 
        button from the old tool completely. This consisted of deleting VBA code and deleting queries within the database. To ensure all unnecessary queries were removed 
        from the database, I went through the tool checking which queries were used or not. Once I documented all of them, I checked the object dependies to make sure the 
        unused queries were not being depended on ones needed. Once thoroughly checking, I began deleting them and checking each button on the tool to make sure they were 
        all still working properly. After removing them, I started to delete code that was no longer needed or simply was not being used.
