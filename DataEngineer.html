                    During my UConn Senior Design Project sponsored by POWWR, I was asked if I would be interested
                    in interning there for winter break. I accepted the position of Data Engineer where I   
                    received experience with MS SQL Server, Google Cloud Platform, Google Big Query, Jira, Agile 
                    methodology, and VBA. 
                </p>
                <p class="main">
                    My mornings here started with a 9 AM scrum meeting where the team would gather in on a conference
                    call with the other employees who worked in different states. The scrum master would go through the 
                    weekly sprint and ask each person what they would be doing for that day and whether or not there were any
                    blockers. On Fridays, we also took the time too look at the quick win Friday board. These tickets were
                    considered quick wins because they could be finished within a couple of hours. 
                </p>
                <p class="main">
                    I quickly became part of the team receiving tickets to complete. My first task to get on my feet was
                    to clean up and format two excel sheets that needed to be uploaded into the MS database. To improve this 
                    weekly process, I created a macro in VBA to automate the clean up and save the files in the proper format. 
                    The user was simply prompted to choose the excel files and the location they wished to save it to by clicking
                    a button on an excel sheet. 
                </p>

                    The rest of the internship consisted of me working on data anomoly detection (DAD) checks. This was done 
                    through dynamic programming in SQL. The tickets would contain a query that needed to be modified using
                    open query. This allowed faster execution of queries on specified linked servers. Once the query was 
                    modified, a procedure was created and stored within the database. Lastly, they were tested against several
                    linked servers to ensure they were working properly. Only then would they be pushed into production for continuous
                    use.
