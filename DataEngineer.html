        <p class="main">
          During my UConn Senior Design Project sponsored by POWWR, I was asked
          if I would be interested in interning there for winter break. I
          accepted the position of Data Engineer where I received experience
          with MS SQL Server, Google Cloud Platform, Google Big Query, Jira,
          Agile methodology, and VBA.
        </p>
        <p class="main">
          My mornings here started with a 9 AM scrum meeting where the team
          would gather in on a conference call with other employees who
          work throughout the United States. The scrum master would go through the
          weekly sprint and ask each person what they would be doing for that
          day and whether or not there were any blockers. On Fridays, we also
          took the time to look at the quick win Friday board. These tickets
          were considered quick wins because they could be finished within a
          couple of hours.
        </p>
        <p class="main">
          I quickly became part of the team receiving tickets to complete. My
          first task to help me on my feet was to clean up and format two excel
          sheets that needed to be uploaded into the MS database. To improve
          this weekly process, I created a macro in VBA to automate the clean up
          and save the files in the proper format. The user simply needed to
          click a button located on an excel sheet where it would then prompt
          them to choose excel file(s) and the location they wished to save it.
          The macro would do the rest, saving the company time since they needed
          this done every week.
        </p>
        <p class="main">
          The rest of the internship consisted of me working on data anomaly
          detection (DAD) checks. This was done through dynamic programming in
          SQL. The tickets would contain a query that needed to be modified
          using open queries. This allowed faster execution of queries on
          specified linked servers. Once the queries were modified, I needed to
          create a procedure that I would store in the database. Lastly, using
          Visual Studio I was able to test them against several linked servers
          to ensure they were working properly. Only then would the procedures
          be pushed into production for continuous use. Although my internship
          here was short, the work I completed was meaningful and a great
          learning experience.
