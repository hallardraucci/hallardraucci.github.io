      <p class="main">
        My first internship was with ISO New England in their IT Day-Ahead
        Support Team. ISO New England is a not-for-profit organizaton that
        operates the power grids, ensuring reliable flow of energy. Day-Ahead
        market is for energy distributers to supply a set price the day before
        for their generators to run as needed. As an intern I worked closely on
        their Solar PV project. There has been an increase in behind the meter
        solar pv. This increase has made it difficult for ISO-NE to accurately
        forecast load because solar pv is about 10% of the total load. We are
        currently seeing about 2400 MW of solar power being used and by 2027 we
        estimate that it will jump to 5000 MW. The goal of this project was to
        incorporate data supplied from outside vendors to improve forecast
        accuracy.
      </p>
      <p class="main">
        The Solar PV team consisted of me and 6 other full time employees. We
        had daily scrum meetings where we would go over our current work and any
        blockers, if any. I created an entity relationship diagram of the
        Postgres database for this project that we used during our meetings.
        This diagram was the basis for the technical design where the data ISO
        receives for this project needed to be stored. I mainly programmed in
        Python and Java but, I also got some exposure in SQL and HTML/CSS. At
        first, I coded in Python a program that outputs the sunset and sunrise
        for the eight load zones (aggregations of specific points on the
        transmission system) for a given start and end date. To ensure my
        program was accurate, I used a credited website to compare the outputs
        of my program. I wrote documentation on the program, running 96 test
        cases with screen shots. Before I created this program, we did not have
        data with such granularity. The difference between Maine and Connecticut
        is 15 minutes which is important for data validation. The generated CSV
        outputs were uploaded to the Postgres Database. These outputs were used
        to ensure that the raw data follows the necessary requirements. For
        example, this will prevent hours with no sunlight from being
        misrepresented by having a megawatt value when it should not. I later
        then coded this program again in Java for future use.
      </p>
      <p class="main">
        Another program I designed in Python was to manipulate CSV files into
        proper format. We were given CSV files from the vendors that would not
        match the Database layout. This code would take a CSV as an input and
        format it properly to match the Database and allow users to upload this
        file without any issues. This program was also coded again in Java for
        the company to use every time a CSV file was received by vendors. A
        small task I was given to get familiar with HTML/CSS and JavaScript was
        to create a website in which a user selects date in which the
        corresponding vendor file would download to the users computer. Towards
        the end of my internship I was able to dabble with the Postgres
        Database. I created a view that would separate the raw data from the
        clean data with a reason column explaining why the data was marked with
        an error. These errors included null values, value before or after
        daylight, and threshold exceedance.
      </p>
      <p class="main">
        The programs I designed during this internship were critical for the
        success of the project. I am happy that I was able to contribute on
        something that would normally have been completed by a full time
        engineer. Throughout this internship I was able to experience the
        engineering work enviornment where we must go through business
        requirement before actually jumping into all the coding that needed to
        be done. This internship allowed me the ability to test my coding skills
        by exploring different coding languages. IT Day-Ahead Support was a
        great learning experience and oppurtunity to explore this field and
        myself.
