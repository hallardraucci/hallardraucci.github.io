            <p class="main"> My first internship was with ISO New England in their IT Day-Ahead Support Team. ISO New
                England is a not-for-profit organizaton that operates the power grids, ensuring reliable flow of energy.
                Day-Ahead market is for energy distributers to supply a set price the day before for their generators
                to run as needed. As an intern I worked closely on their Solar PV project. The increase in solar panels
                have made it difficult for accurate load forecasting. The goal of this project was to incorporate data from 
                outside vendors to improve this accuracy. 
            </p>
            <p class="main"> The Solar PV team consisted of me and 6 other full time employees. We had daily scrum meetings 
                where we would go over our current work and any blockers, if any. I created an entity relationship diagram 
                of the Postgres database for this project that we used during our meetings. I mainly programmed in Python and Java
                but also got some exposure in SQL and HTML/CSS. At first, I coded in Python a program that outputs the sunset and sunrise
                for the eight load zones (aggregations of specific points on the transmission system) for a given start and end date. 
                To ensure my program was accurate, I used a credited website to compare the outputs of my program. I wrote documentation 
                on the program, running 96 test cases with screen shots. Once this was completed, the CSV outputs were uploaded
                to the Postgres Database, where it was used to filter out bad data. The data was considered bad if the time stamp was
                marked either before or after daylight. I later then coded this program again in Java for future use. 
            </p>
            <p class="main"> Another program I designed in Python was to manipulate CSV files into proper format. We were given CSV files
                from the vendors that would not match the Database layout. This code would take a CSV as an input and format it properly
                to match the Database and allow users to upload this file without any issues. Later, I then reprogrammed this design in 
                Java for future use.
