      <h4> UConn Senior Design Project</h4>
      <p class="main">
        POWWR provides a forecast up to 30 days out using weather-responsive
        load forecast algorithms to give clients visibilty into future energy
        load usage based on forecasted weather conditions. POWWR also provides a
        long-range forecast based on all the client's customers and usage
        history. They take in the information through the client's billing
        system allowing them to create an accurate long term forecast even with
        the ever-changing account mix of a client.
      </p>
      <p class="main">
        The basis of the first semester for Senior Design 1 was to create a top-down
        model that could predict future energy consumption in megawatt hours
        (MwH) in a regional level. To do this we utilized a machine learning technique called
        regression. This allows the model to predict future values based on
        similar record usage from the past. We strictly used recorded hourly
        usage and weather data from the past to form this model. Partitions
        along attributes of the large dataset are crucial to increase the
        accuracy in the model. Initially, we approached this problem by
        partitioning the data by weather station and month, then later adding
        day of the week. The days of the week were grouped by weekday versus
        Saturday versus Sunday. Weather station and month alone gave us 168
        subsets of data to run our model on. The 168 subsets were obtained by
        using 14 weather stations within the regional energy transmission
        organization and the 12 months of the year. Once we split the data
        further into days of the week, we got 504 subsets of data. By grouping
        the data by month and day, it allowed us to compare similar trends
        within the data. For example, this prevents us from comparing a data
        point in the month of January to a data point in July where the MwH
        consumption will differ due to weather anaomalies.
      </p>
      <p class="main">
        One problem we needed to prevent was overfitting the data. Overfitting
        occurs when the model gives an accurate
        prediction for the training data set but gives worse predictions for other
        data sets. To avoid overfitting we used 3-fold cross validation, which is a method that
        randomly assigns each of the 504 subsets into one of three categories.
        Two of the three categories are then used to train the model. Then the
        final category of data is then used to train the model. This process is
        repeated with each possible permutation of two training categories and
        one validation category. The final result is the average score of all
        the permutations scores.
      </p>
      <p class="main">
        For our model, we used a combination of random forest, extra trees, and AdaBoost algorithms.
        The accuracy of our model was measured using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). 
        A lower MAPE score means a higher accuracy of the model. Our team was able to
        successfully achieve a model that produces a MAPE score of 3.63%, an
        improvement from our goal of 10% error. 
      </p>
      <p class="main">
        Similarly to the top-down model, we wanted to predict future energy usage, but,
        at a client level rather than regional level for semester two. We merged weather
        data from all local weather stations for specific clients. Then we went through 
        a process of feature selection to determine which weather variables should be 
        included in our models. This led to eight different models being created. Each model
        used various combinations of weather attributes and dimensionality reduction techniques to
        preprocess the data in different ways. We then proceeded to partition, train, fine-tune,
        and test similarly to the top down model. After comparing the results for all eight models, 
        we found that a model containing six weather variables with season partitioning performed the best.
        Although these results were not as consisted as the first semester, we found that in general our
        results were comparable.
      </p>
            <p class="main">
              Throughout this project we learned how to use many tools and
              technologies to help us complete the models such as: agile methodology,
              Bitbucket, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Teams, and Jupyter Notebook.
              Another technique we learned how to do through this class was how to work in a 
              team. This was our most difficult experience for the project.
