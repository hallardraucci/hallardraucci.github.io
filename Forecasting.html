        POWWR provides a forecast up to 30 days out using weather-responsive
        load forecast algorithms to give clients visibilty into future energy
        load usage based on forecasted weather conditions. POWWR also provides a
        long-range forecast based on all the client's customers and usage
        history. They take in the information through the client's billing
        system allowing them to create an accurate long term forecast even with
        the ever-changing account mix of a client.

      <p class="main">
        The basis of the first semester for Senior Design 1 was to create a
        model that could predict future energy consumption in megawatt hours
        (MwH). To do this we utilized a machine learning technique called
        regression. This allows the model to predict future values based on
        similar record usage from the past. We strictly used recorded hourly
        usage and weather data from the past to form this model. Partitions
        along attributes of the large dataset are crucial to increase the
        accuracy in the model. Initially, we approached this problem by
        partitioning the data by weather station and month, then later adding
        day of the week. The days of the week were grouped by weekday versus
        Saturday versus Sunday. Weather station and month alone gave us 168
        subsets of data to run our model on. The 168 subsets were obtained by
        using 14 weather stations within the regional energy transmission
        organization and the 12 months of the year. Once we split the data
        further into days of the week, we got 504 subsets of data. By grouping
        the data by month and day, it allowed us to compare similar trends
        within the data. For example, this prevents us from comparing a data
        point in the month of January to a data point in July where the MwH
        consumption will differ due to weather anaomalies.
      </p>
      <p class="main">
        One problem we needed to prevent was overfitting the data. Overfitting
        occurs when the model is too constrained and gives an accurate
        prediction for the trained data set but not for any other supplied data
        set. This in turn makes in a poor predictor of future data points. This
        was avoided by using 3-fold cross validation, which is a method that
        randomly assigns each of the 504 subsets into one of three categories.
        Two of the three categories are then used to train the model. In the
        final category of data is then used to train the model. This process is
        repeated with each possible permutation of two training categories and
        one validation category. The final result is the average score of all
        the permutations scores.
      </p>
      <p class="main">
        In our model, we used Random Forest Regressor, Extra Trees Regressor,
        and AdaBoost Regressor against all 504 subsets. The accuracy of our
        model was measured using mean absolue percentage error (MAPE). A lower
        MAPE score means a higher accuracy of the model. Our team was able to
        successfully achieve a model that produces a MAPE score of 3.63%, an
        improvement from our goal of 10% error.
      </p>
      <p class="main">
        Throughout this project we learned how to use many tools and
        technologies to help us complete the model such as: agile methodology,
        Bitbucket, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Teams, and Jupyter Notebook.
        We used agile methodology to create tickets through Jira for the tasks
        we needed to complete for the model and assigned them to individuals in
        the team. This helped us remain organized on the work being completed.
        We met with POWWR weekly through a Zoom video conference to discuss the
        work we had completed in the previous week and go over the next steps in
        our project. We utilized these meetings to ask questions, demo work, and
        keep POWWR informed with our school requirements for the project.
      </p>
      <p class="main">
        This semester we will move on in creating an additional model using data
        in larger areas. This will force us to group weather station data by
        zone to find their average temperature and hourly usage data.
